ading a admin dashboard 
=>in app.js of admin dashboard we will set stats of user on chart of home page
so fro that we will get state or get data thoug databse by axios 

re.data is an array so we will use the map fuction for displying the month by the id we wil do minus 1 from each id becox aur months are started from 0th length

we gave months as a name and total users as a new user 

we use useMemo hook for memorizing the old number of previous users

for shorting the months we will use sort mathod and subtract a id with b id

=>now we will create  a movies context 
1>MoviesActions
2>MoviesReducer
3>MovieContext
4>Movies Api

=>export the getmovie function from movies api and chage things in product list

=now we render a movie context in index.js
